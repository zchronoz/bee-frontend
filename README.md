# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# About the project

## Objective

This project was made to be used as a test of technical capacity.
The project lists companies, requested from an api, where it was made available through a json and using json-server.

## Resources

Styled-Components was used for styling, axios was used for request and react-router-dom for routing.

## Finalization

At first I kept the React documentation, telling how to run the project.
The project was made componentized, to have greater reuse.
There are points of improvement that could be addressed as better error handling and better representation of the request wait.
